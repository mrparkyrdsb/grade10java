# IPO Model

An Input-Processing-Output (IPO) Model is a tool that helps to design basic programs. By using an IPO Model, it eases the process of translating our requirements to code.

## Our Example Problem
> The client has requested for a fahrenheit to celsius converting program

### Input Analysis
> __Input:__ Analyzing the inputs that the program requires to solve the given problem
- The program needs to be given a fahrenheit value.
- It should be a numeric value that supports decimals and negatives

### Processing Analysis
> __Processing:__ Analyzing how we would use the input to calculate or process our inputs and variables
```
    let F represent fahrenheit
    let C represent celsius
    
    (F − 32) × 5/9 = C
```
- To convert a fahrenheit temperature to celsius, we can use the the formula stated above

### Output Analysis
> __Output:__ Stating the expected output after processing is done
- The program can output the conversion as a text
